description: Introduction to MySQL

The course on this page offers introduction to the structured query language (SQL) with MySQL dialect, guide learners towards commonly used operations and techniques, and prepare then for writing more efficient, less resource-intensive, and - in a consequence - faster database query statements.

This content and presented examples are based on [MySQL 8.4](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/) - the most recent version offering a long-term support (LTS) release that is current at the time of writing. However, most techniques and syntax are not only transferrable to other versions of that database software, but also to other relational databases, often without or just with minor modifications.
